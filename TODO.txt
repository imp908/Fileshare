I:
0 Repo (against SQL base and Northwind base)
-> Merge Repo with (T , Tid) for key oprations 
with Interface TGR for several operations on one entity
-> Generic Repo with (T , Tid), CRUD
pass implementation specific repo to fully generic
-> cahnge Sector and User interfaces to generic Edit repo Select by SecondaryID delete by SecondaryID
-> Simplify Repo calls with ID and CRUD specific, moove all BILogic
(sector,user,manager,merchant - (ID), date -(date)) to Manager above UOW. UOW only simple operations
0 WCF
-> Add WCF between Repo and Site
-> Add JS multiple model items update at one time
-> to DLL
1 PresentationSite
-> parsing excel file to objects method decompose to several
	///Sector type from filename
	///Fist file input determines merchant sector
	parse file mask;
	
	if parsed then
	{
	
		get sector id from filename; --from config
		get property fields; --from config
		if(no merchant column then error); --from parser

		foreach row
		{
			check merchant doubles for this sector; --from UOF
			remove doubles; --from UOF
			insert; --from UOF
		}
		
	}

	-> Export to excel
-> Type converter for migration (
Add SQL to CLR type conversion ; 
SQLEntity to DWH entity converter; 
Converter logic to string name or type name;)

SB , Repo and UOF to different projects  <- done
Northwind -> change login employee get from TempData to model  <- done
Northwind -> add complex model add  <- done
Tables migration - test with repo <- done
II:
0 Polinom Parse -> parse *^/ to expressions and add priorities for exprs
0 Command line app dll -> to SB
0 Multithread message ping pong -> to SB
0 Console parameters parse -> to SB
